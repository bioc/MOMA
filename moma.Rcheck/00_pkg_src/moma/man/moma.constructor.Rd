\arguments{
\item{viper}{VIPER protein activity matrix with samples as columns and rows as protein IDs}

\item{mut}{An indicator matrix (0/1) of mutation events with samples as columns and genes as rows}

\item{cnv}{A matrix of CNV scores (typically SNP6 array scores from TCGA) with samples as columns and genes as rows}

\item{fusions}{An indicator matrix (0/1) of fusion events with samples as columns and genes as rows}

\item{pathways}{A named list of lists. Each named list represents interactions between proteins (keys) and their associated partners}

\item{gene.blacklist}{A vector of genes to exclude from mutational/CNV/fusion analysis}

\item{output.folder}{Location to store output and intermediate results}

\item{gene.loc.mapping}{A data.frame of band locations and Entrez IDs}
}
