\title{Use 'aREA' to calculate the enrichment between each genomic event - VIPER inferred protein pair.}
\usage{
associate.events(
  vipermat,
  events.mat,
  min.events = NA,
  whitelist = NA,
  blacklist = NA,
  event.type = c("Amplifications", "Deletions", "Mutations", "Fusions", NA)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vipermat}{Pre-computed VIPER scores with samples as columns and proteins as rows}

\item{events.mat}{Binary 0/1 events matrix with samples as columns and genes or events as rows}

\item{min.events}{Only compute enrichment if the number of samples with these events is GTE to this}

\item{whitelist}{Only compute associations for events in this list}

\item{blacklist}{Exclude associations for events in this list}

\item{event.type}{Name of the event type being analyzed}
}
\value{
A matrix of aREA scores, dimensions are nrow(events.mat) x nrow(vipermat)
}
\description{
Requires pre-computed VIPER scores and a binary events matrix. Will use only samples in both event and VIPER matrices.
